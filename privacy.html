    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Updated: 31 October 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p><strong>Maltese First Capital</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) is established in Malta. Registered office: <em>[Insert Registered Address]</em>.
       If licensed, insert: <em>Authorised and regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), licence no. <strong>[Insert licence]</strong></em>.

    <h2>2. Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy explains how we collect, use, disclose and protect personal data when you visit our website, submit enquiries, or apply to open an account.
       It applies to this website and our intake portals.</p>

    <h2>3. Our role and legal bases (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>We act as a <strong>data controller</strong> for personal data processed for onboarding, compliance and communication. Our lawful bases include:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contract</strong> — processing necessary to consider and manage your application or client relationship;</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> — compliance with AML/CFT, sanctions, and record-keeping duties under Maltese/EU law;</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — site security (e.g., bot protection via Cloudflare Turnstile), fraud prevention, and service improvement;</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> — where required (e.g., optional analytics/marketing cookies).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identity & KYC</strong>: name, date of birth, nationality, identification documents, proof of address, corporate documents, beneficial ownership.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact</strong>: email, phone, correspondence content.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical</strong>: IP address, device/agent metadata, security challenge results (e.g., Turnstile), and logs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. How we use data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Assess and process applications; perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring.</li>
      <li>Meet AML/CFT, sanctions and other regulatory obligations.</li>
      <li>Secure our services (rate limiting, bot/abuse prevention).</li>
      <li>Respond to enquiries and manage our relationship with you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Retention</h2>
    <p>We generally retain onboarding and KYC records for <strong>at least five (5) years</strong> from the end of the business relationship or the date of an occasional transaction,
    and up to <strong>seven (7) years</strong> where legally required. Enquiry correspondence is retained for a shorter period unless needed for legal/regulatory reasons.</p>

    <h2>7. Sharing</h2>
    <p>We may share data with:
      (i) regulators, law enforcement and courts when required by law; (ii) compliance, due diligence, and cloud service providers bound by contract;
      (iii) payment, banking or custodial partners necessary to provide services. We do not sell personal data.</p>

    <h2>8. International transfers</h2>
    <p>Where data is transferred outside the EEA, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses).</p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement technical and organisational measures including encryption in transit, access controls, file type/size restrictions, bot protection, and audit logging.
    No system is 100% secure; residual risk remains.</p>
